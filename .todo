# Word Search Game - Quasar Migration Plan

## Overview

Migrating a vanilla JS word search game to Quasar Vue 3 framework.

## Phase 1: Project Structure & Core Setup ✅

- [x] Initialize Quasar project
- [x] Move old code to ws-old directory
- [x] Configure Quasar for game requirements (animations, SVG support)
- [x] Set up proper ESLint rules for Vue 3 composition API
- [x] Install additional dependencies (canvas-confetti)

## Phase 2: Data & State Management ✅

- [x] Convert categories.js to Pinia store (categoriesStore)
- [x] Create gameStore for game state management
  - [x] Current game state (grid, words, found words)
  - [x] Timer state
  - [x] Score tracking
  - [x] Game settings
- [x] Create userStore for persistent data
  - [x] Stats/wins
  - [x] User preferences
  - [x] High scores

## Phase 3: Utility Migration ✅

- [x] Convert utils to composables:
  - [x] useStorage.js - localStorage wrapper (replaced by Pinia stores)
  - [x] useAudio.js - sound effects management
  - [x] useAnimations.js - game animations (merged into useGameAnimations.js)
  - [x] useScore.js - scoring logic (merged into useGameStats.js)
- [x] Create additional composables:
  - [x] useTimer.js - timer functionality
  - [x] useWordSearch.js - core game logic (merged into useWordGrid.js)

## Phase 4: Component Migration ✅

- [x] Create Vue components:
  - [x] GameGrid.vue - Main word search grid (from grid.js)
  - [x] WordList.vue - List of words to find
  - [x] GameTimer.vue - Timer display (from timer.js)
  - [x] SettingsPanel.vue - Settings sidebar (from settings.js)
  - [x] StartMenu.vue - Main menu (from startMenu.js)
  - [x] TopBar.vue - Game header with timer/score
  - [x] EndGameModal.vue - Victory/game over modal
  - [x] ProgressBar.vue - Bottom progress indicator

## Phase 5: Game Logic Migration ✅

- [x] Port game.js logic to composables/stores:
  - [x] Word placement algorithm (useWordGrid.js)
  - [x] Selection/highlighting logic (useWordSelection.js)
  - [x] Word validation (useWordGrid.js)
  - [x] Game completion detection (useGameStats.js)
- [x] Implement touch/mouse event handling in Vue way (useWordSelection.js)
- [x] SVG line drawing for word selection (GameGrid.vue)

## Phase 6: Routing & Pages ✅

- [x] Set up Vue Router:
  - [x] / - Start menu page
  - [x] /game - Main game page
  - [x] /stats - Statistics page
  - [x] /upgrades - Upgrades page (if implemented)
- [x] Create page components for each route

## Phase 7: Styling & UI ✅

- [x] Convert CSS to Quasar/Vue approach:
  - [x] Use Quasar components where appropriate
  - [x] Migrate custom styles to component-scoped styles
  - [x] Implement responsive design with Quasar breakpoints
- [x] Dark mode support

## Phase 8: Testing & Optimization ✅

- [x] Add unit tests for game logic
  - [x] Grid generation and word placement
  - [x] Timer functionality
- [x] Test touch interactions on mobile
  - [x] Add touch-action CSS property
  - [x] Use passive event listeners
  - [x] Add proper touch target size
  - [x] Add visual feedback for touch
  - [x] Optimize for touch devices
- [x] Performance optimization:
  - [x] Lazy loading for routes
  - [x] Optimize grid rendering
    - [x] Use CSS Grid with CSS variables
    - [x] Flatten grid data structure
    - [x] Add v-memo and v-once directives
    - [x] Optimize DOM updates
  - [x] Minimize re-renders
    - [x] Add v-memo for conditional classes
    - [x] Use shallowRef for modals
    - [x] Add contain CSS property
    - [x] Optimize watchers with flush: 'post'

## Phase 9: Cleanup & Polish

- [x] Remove ws-old directory after migration
- [x] Update README with new setup instructions
- [x] Add proper types via jsdocs
- [~] Code review and refactoring for DRY principles
  - [x] Create useTimeFormat composable for consistent time formatting
  - [ ] Review and refactor score formatting
  - [ ] Review and refactor game settings management
  - [ ] Review and refactor animation handling
- [ ] Add proper error handling

## Current Status: Phase 9 - Cleanup & Polish

Next step: Continue code review and refactoring, focusing on score formatting, game settings, and animation handling.

## Notes:

- Keep game logic separate from UI components
- Use Composition API for better code organization
- Leverage Quasar's built-in components to reduce custom code
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Consider adding PWA capabilities (Quasar makes this easy)
